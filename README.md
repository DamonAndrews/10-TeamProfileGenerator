This submission allows a user to create a team using a command interface. The user is immediately prompted to enter their manager's information when launching, and can choose to add engineers or interns to their team after that. The user can enter as many engineers or interns as they would like, and can select "Build Team" when done to create an HTML page. Upon loading the page, the team's information is displayed in cards on the page.

Object-Oriented Programming Challenge: Team Profile Generator
Your challenge is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Because testing is key to making code maintainable, you’ll also write unit tests for each part of your code and ensure that it passes all of them.

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the tests passing. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.

Refer to the Video Submission Guide (Links to an external site.) on the Full-Stack Blog for additional guidance on creating a video.
